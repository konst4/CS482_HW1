<p>The first step of the program was to load the original image. Then the resize operation will scale, the image to 512 by 512. After this operation, the image needed to be split into three components using the split function. After this step , a Gaussian filter should be applied. The kernel size that I defined was 15 by 15. The next step was to apply the filter using the different sigma values of 1, 2, and 3 on the three different color component images. After applying the Filter, the next step was to merge the three different components together for each sigma value to get the colored image but more smoothed and  with less noise. The greater the sigma value the more blurry the image became(less noisy). The next step was to take the derivatives of these newly smoothed images as well as the original. OpenCV has a great function called Sobel. After getting the derivatives in the x and in the "y" direction. It was time to do some edge detection(hopefully this means the magnitude of images). There is a function called Canny which uses the algorithm in class, that we discussed. By changing the gradient size more detail was  either gained or lost. The last part was to write all of our newly made images to files to share them . </p>
